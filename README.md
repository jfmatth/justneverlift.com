This is my site for all things I do at NASA.  I'm not much of a blogger or writer but will try to put videos, thoughts, links, etc. here for everyone to enjoy.

## Building the site
For each update, change the VERSION file to reflect the version of the container that runs the site.  I use the date format v.YYYY.MM.DD

Enjoy
