## A fun race Saturday at Chuckwalla CCW

Didn't qualify due to time in classroom, so that's OK, makes it more exciting.  

Lap 1 - Came out of the bowl and Alex that it would be OK to slam into my drivers side, it's OK, I owe him lots.  For some dumb reason, I thought going over 9/10 at a hot clip for the first lap was a good idea, immediately lost grip, into the dirt and THANK GOD  no one hit me, very stupid move.  Now I'm at the back of the whole pack, lets go

Lap 2 - Caught the BMW 328 for some reason, Palomar Solar.  They were silly fast just a few years ago, might be re-working the car, not sure.  That dude the in 'brown' Miata in the back is quick, I don't know if he qualified either, but fun to race with.  

Later in the race, I finally catch the Porsche (Carl) and the Miata(Adam), they were having a great battle (due to Carl having old tires).  Carl is much quicker with new rubber.  Adam is a great driver and faster than me in a straight line (I think it's the 205's vs 225).  

I finally get around Adam and catch Carl, hoping for a fun race, but the fool loses it and goes off (his 3rd in the race) oh well.  The win was mine from there.

Enjoy
