## Huge field, not a lot of action

A great kick-off to the 2025 racing season at [Chuckwalla Valley Raceway](https://chuckwalla.com/).  A hell of a drive to get there, but pretty awesome once you're settled in.

{{< youtube 9StS2WyeUz8 >}}  

I was able to qualify on pole in the '95 Red Miata with 20 less horses than we should have, that's OK, the Hoosiers always make up for it.

The race itself was uneventful other than Wilson (red Miata to my right) and the other guy (to my left) getting a good start on me, that's ok, took less than a lap to pass Wilson and then it was all she wrote.

If you listen closely, you'll see I was having trouble getting into 4th gear everywhere, and the revving you hear initially is my attempts to get it into gear.  I finally started to double-clutch and that seemed to help.

Enjoy
