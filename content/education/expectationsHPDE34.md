## What do I expect of incoming drivers for 3/4
I truly enjoy teaching the HPDE 3/4 group for NASA.  The main reason I teach for NASA is to make people faster, simple as that.  I try to transfer my 'wisdom' of being on the track for 20+ years and see if it helps you go faster.

That being said, I have a few expectations and rules for my group

## What should drivers know about driving with NASA
I'll assume you've been through our HPDE 1/2 program with an instructor and have at least two weekends under your belt, or you've been with other clubs and have an understanding of the track.

NASA does do a few things differently than other clubs and it's important for drivers to know this, so they can have the best experience for the weekend.

Here are some basics I'll assume you know:
- You're registered and have verfied everything (read all the emails, etc.)
- Your car has passed through tech-inspection, or you know what to do after the drivers meeting
- You go to the correct moring and download sessions

## Rules for HPDE 3/4 with me
As I mentioned, I'm here to make everyone go faster.  We are all adults and if we can follow the few simple rules I have, we can spend our time going of technique versus why you didn't follow the rules.

My Ruleset  HPDE 3/4:
- All straightaways are open passing, no point-by required, although appreciated
- All drivers must put a "3" or "4" on your back driver window (this is for passing rules)
- If you approach a "3" car in a turn, they must point you by for you to pass
- If you approach a "4" car in a turn, you may pass without a point by safely
- If you are going to do a late-pass (i.e. divebomb) into a turn, you must point-by, regardless of number

After each session, we'll have a download in the classroom to go over any incidents or issues.  If you don't want to be there, check with the leader and get a track pass and you may leave.

## Classroom sessions - What are the good for?
I've been told many times that the classroom sessions are very helpful for drivers, and that makes me happy.  I'm here to make you faster.

The classroom is pretty simple:
- show up, get a track pass
  - If you don't want to stick around or have car issues, check with the group leader and leave
- We cover any incidents (offs, break-downs, misbehavior, etc.)
- Questions about turns, techniques, wisdome, etc.

I like to spend the majority of the classroom using any incidents as learning opportunities for everyone.  If you want to progress in your driving, you have to learn from your and others mistakes.
